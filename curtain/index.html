                            I think the most difficult point lies in writing javascript. Especially the logic of controlling the navigation bar with the keyboard. Because I have been exposed to c++ a lot before, I would write javascript with the thinking of c++, which left me completely confused. However, the web develop course only introduced a few simple functions of javascript. So I searched for a lot of materials and videos online, and learned the source codes of many websites. Finally, I created this function.

                                repository structure (e.g., <code>homepage</code>, <code>portfolio</code> modules) to ensure
                                code maintainability and user experience. Below are the core technologies and tools used:

                            This web design project was a fun and exciting journey for me. I started with HTML to make the basic parts of my webpage. I learned how to use tags like div to build a simple structure. Also, I studied CSS to make my pages look nice. I learned about the box model, positioning, and display styles like flex and grid. I faced some hard parts, like fixing JavaScript errors and matching styles across files. But I kept trying. This project helped me grow a lot. I went from knowing nothing to making a full website that works well and looks good. I learned to think about users and make my site easy for everyone to use. I'm really proud of my progress. Now I want to learn more, like how to use React for better websites and study UI/UX to make designs even nicer. I also want to help my community by making websites for local groups to share ideas about the environment.
