                            I think the most difficult point lies in writing javascript. Especially the logic of controlling the navigation bar with the keyboard. Because I have been exposed to c++ a lot before, I would write javascript with the thinking of c++, which left me completely confused. However, the web develop course only introduced a few simple functions of javascript. So I searched for a lot of materials and videos online, and learned the source codes of many websites. Finally, I created this function.

                                This project applies Design-Thinking methodology, focusing on modular development based on
                                repository structure (e.g., <code>homepage</code>, <code>portfolio</code> modules) to ensure
                                code maintainability and user experience. Below are the core technologies and tools used:

                            This web design project for my CS class was a good experience. I started with HTML to create my webpage's structure. I used tags like div, header, p, and a to build it. For example, I made a nav bar and content area with div, and added links between pages using a tags. It was interesting to see the site take shape step by step.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, I used CSS to style the webpage. I learned about the box model, which includes margins, padding, and borders. I added padding to buttons to make them look better and used margins to space out sections. I also used flexbox to align my nav bar neatly and grid to make a photo gallery that adjusts to different screen sizes. Choosing colors and fonts was fun, and I tested different styles to find what worked best.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript was challenging. My slideshow had errors, and it took time to fix them. I used the browser console to find mistakes, which helped me solve the problem. Keeping styles consistent across pages was also hard. I used CSS classes to make sure everything looked the same, and it took some effort to get it right.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project helped me improve a lot. I started with no web design skills and ended up with a website that works well and looks decent. I thought about users while building it. I added alt text to images so everyone could use the site. I also tested it on my phone to make sure it was responsive and checked that it worked with just a keyboard for navigation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm satisfied with my progress. I went from basic HTML to adding small animations with CSS, like buttons that change color on hover. I also used JavaScript to check form inputs, which was tricky but worth it. Each part of the project taught me something new, and I liked seeing it all come together. Building a full website from scratch was a big accomplishment, and I feel more confident in my skills now.
